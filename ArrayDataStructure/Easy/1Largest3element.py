#Find the largest three elements in an array
#Find the largest three distinct elements in an array

#Algorithm:


# 1) Initialize the largest three elements as minus infinite.
#     first = second = third = -?
# 2) Iterate through all elements of array.
#    a) Let current array element be x.
#    b) If (x > first)
#       {
#           // This order of assignment is important
#           third = second
#           second = first
#           first = x
#        }
#    c)  Else if (x > second and x != first)
#       {
#           third = second
#           second = x
#       }
#    d)  Else if (x > third and x != second)
#       {
#           third = x
#       }
# 3) Print first, second and third.
